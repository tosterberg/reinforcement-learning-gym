# RL Gymnasium

This repo is an exploratory codebase for learning and interacting with reinforcement learning concepts, libraries, and notebooks.

## Intro

The goal of this project is to learn through practice by implementing a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms. The project can be broken up into two sections: algorithms, and integrations. Where integrations will be interfaces with other packages that provide test environments for RL.

## Notes

- Action-Value
- Stationary *k*-armed Bandit Problems
- Non-stationary *k*-armed Bandit Problems

## Algorithms

1. greedy
2. Îµ-greedy
3. Optimistic Initial Values
4. Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB)
5. Bandit Gradient Algorithm
6. Associative Search (Contextual Bandits)

## Component Algorithms

1. argmax
